# üì≤ Notifications

## üëÄ Overview

**Notifications** is a simple Android app that demonstrates **status bar notifications** and **heads-up popups**. It‚Äôs a practical example for learning how to show attention-grabbing notifications while keeping your app lightweight.

The app has **one screen** with **two buttons**:

1. ** First Button**  
   - Shows a push notification in the status bar and notification shade.  
   - Displays a heads-up popup while the app is in focus.  

2. ** Second Button**  
   - Navigates to the home screen.  
   - Shows a push notification in the status bar and notification shade.  
   - Displays a heads-up popup even when the device is in sleep mode.  
   - **Tip:** Press the second button and then the power button to test sleep mode notifications.
